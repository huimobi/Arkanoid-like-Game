## Arkanoid-like-Game
Arkanoid is an arcade game from the 1980s, in which the player controls a Space Vessel called the Vaus, that sends a ball upwards in order to collide with the bricks above and destroy them. This is a Java recreation of that classic game.

## Grade & Retrospective
**Final Grade:** **17.9/20**

Despite a few unsolved bugs, this project was very important for the understanding of the **Model-View-Controller(MVC)** design pattern, as well as to consolidate my Java knowledge. I'am very proud of the piece of software we built and of the experience gained throughout the process.
