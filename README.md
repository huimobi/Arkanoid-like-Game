## Main task
Developing an Arkanoid-like game in Java, using GUI integration of Lanterna. As in the original version, there are multiple levels (we intend to implement 5) in which the player controls a paddle that sends a ball upwards in order to collide with the bricks above and destroy them. These are disposed in diverse ways, be it in a big chunk of 10x6 or in a stair format, considering that each brick is 15x8pixels. There are different brick colors, having each one of them different points associated (some of them drop powerups). When the player catches a powerup it might either affect the paddle or the ball.
